# CSS Course

Hey, here you can find all the resources for the CSS course. You'll also see the necessary resources below each video on the website of course.

At the top level, there is a folder for each project and then 3 files: a file for the slides, a readme file and a file for bugs in the course. The readme file is what you're reading right now because GitHub displays the content of the readme file by default.

In each of the project folders, you can find its resources (font, images, etc.) and final code of each video of that project. You can use those when you're stuck. Simply copy the content of the files of a particular video into your own files and you'll be up to speed. During project 2, if you copy and paste the **package.json** file then you should also run the `npm install` command so that the installed dependencies are also updated.

## Questions

### Q1: Something is not working! What should I do?
**A:** Follow these steps:
1. Check if you made any typos. Also, check your terminals (if we're using those in the videos) to see if there are errors, fix those and try again. This will fix your issue 99% of the time so make sure you've done this thoroughly.
2. Still not working? Check the file in this repo called 'bugs' and see if your problem is present and follow the steps there.
3. Still not working? In this repo, you can find the files for the video you're stuck at, this is the final code of the video. Copy and paste the content of a particular file you suspect is the cause into your own file (e.g. only the style.css file). Check if it works. If it doesn't, copy the content of all files into your own files. If you're stuck in project 2, make sure to run the command `npm install` in a new terminal (to install the correct dependencies after changing the **package.json** file). Check if it works.
4. Still not working? Please open an issue for this GitHub repository with a clear description of what's not working. Please also include a [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) or a screenshot of your code. This makes it faster for me to help you.
    
I'm online throughout most of the day and will help you as quickly as I can! In the meantime, I apologize for the inconvenience. Sometimes things break after recording the videos, but I try to be quick with any bugs that come up.

### Q2: How can I contact you?
**A:** You can always contact me by email: support@bytegrad.com, but please open an issue for this GitHub repository to submit problems with the course. I simply don't have the time to respond to thousands of emails.
